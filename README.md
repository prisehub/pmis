==============================

Customize the PM UI to follow the pmbok and iso 21500. Provide the dependencies
needed for project planning, resource planning, billing plan, stakeholders
management, risk management, integrates the crm features with project
management and aims to make the project form as the center form to manage all
the activities for a project oriented company organization.

to keep the main project view less cluttered. It also aims to keep the
insertion order oriented towards the productivity following the most usual
Project Management Initiation and Planning workflow as per PMBOK and ISO 21500.
