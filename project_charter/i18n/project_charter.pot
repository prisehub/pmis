"PROJECT OBJECTIVES\n"
"The success of your project will be defined by how well you\n"
"meet your objectives. The more explicitly you state your\n"
"objectives at the outset, the less disagreement there will\n"
"be at the end about whether you have met them. Remember\n"
"that at this early stage of the project, there are still\n"
"many “unknown factors”. Be prepared to revise your\n"
"objectives as you gather more information about what you\n"
"need to achieve.\n"
"\n"
"WRITING PROJECT OBJECTIVES\n"
"Project objectives are concrete statements that describe\n"
"what the project is trying to achieve. Objectives should\n"
"be developed for time, cost, quality (or functionality)\n"
"and should:\n"
"\n"
"* Be aligned to business objectives\n"
"* Be measurable\n"
"* Be achievable\n"
"* Be consistent\n"
"* Be readily understandable\n"
"* Be few in number\n"
"* Have the full support and commitment of key stakeholders\n"

"Project constraints are known facts that will influence how\n"
"the project is planned and managed. A constraint is a given\n"

"The scope is what the project contains or delivers (i.e. the\n"
"products or services). When starting to plan the scope of the\n"

#: help:project.requirement,requirements:0
msgid "\n"
"The user requirements of the project must be defined and\n"
"documented. Approval and confirmation must be obtained\n"
"before the project can proceed. To obtain agreement about\n"
"needs:\n"
"\n"
"* Separate needs from wants\n"
"* Group the needs that are similar\n"
"* Prioritise needs (eg essential, nice to have)\n"
"* Identify any conflicting needs\n"
"* Negotiate agreement between stakeholders with\n"
"   conflicting needs\n"
"\n"
"This process often requires a number of meetings with\n"
"stakeholders. Stakeholders often express their needs in\n"
"terms of a particular product or solution to the problem,\n"
"which has created the need for the project in the first\n"
"place. It is important to re-state the agreed needs in\n"
"terms of “what the end product/service(s) of the project\n"
"should do”.\n"
"Stating the agreed needs in functional terms permits the\n"
"project manager to offer a range of solutions to the client\n"
"or key stakeholders. If the project outcomes are restricted\n"
"to solutions offered by key stakeholders too early in the\n"
"analysis process important alternative options might be\n"
"overlooked. Document the final set of agreed requirements\n"
"and obtain sign-off from all key stakeholders.\n"
