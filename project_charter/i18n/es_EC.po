"PROJECT OBJECTIVES\n"
"The success of your project will be defined by how well you\n"
"meet your objectives. The more explicitly you state your\n"
"objectives at the outset, the less disagreement there will\n"
"be at the end about whether you have met them. Remember\n"

"WRITING PROJECT OBJECTIVES\n"
"Project objectives are concrete statements that describe\n"
"what the project is trying to achieve. Objectives should\n"
"be developed for time, cost, quality (or functionality)\n"
"and should:\n"
"\n"
"* Be aligned to business objectives\n"
"* Be measurable\n"
"* Be achievable\n"
