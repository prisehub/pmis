Project Charter
==============================

Customizes the PM UI to follow the pmbok and iso 21500
document Project Charter, with all it's contents:
    - project charter
    - project description (with ckeditor4)
    - project scope
    - project boundaries, assumptions and constraints
    - project stakeholders
    - resource and billing plan

The project form is redesigned in a two-level notebook (to simulate sub menus) to keep
the main project view less cluttered. It also aims to keep the insertion order oriented
towards the productivity following the most usual Project Management Initiation and
Planning workflow as per PMBOK and ISO 21500.
